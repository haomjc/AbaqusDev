考虑到摆线轮与针齿间接触存在非线性，理论计算与实际运行工况下的应变之间存在误差。为准确计算摆线针轮间扭转刚度，采用Abaqus二次开发语言python完成摆线针轮有限元分析程序的开发。

Considering the nonlinearity of the contact between the cycloid wheel and the needle teeth, there is an error between the theoretical calculation and the strain under the actual operating conditions. In order to accurately calculate the torsional stiffness between the cycloid pinwheels, the development of the finite element analysis program for the cycloid pinwheels was completed by using Abaqus secondary development language python.
